We will use Bootstrap, Jquery, JavaScript.
We will also use MVC technology using Razor.

The different pages:

* image web- The main page of our website. All data are read in time
Running from a file / requesting information from a service

* Config - The Handlers list will have a list of tags or buttons
(Meaning a clickable tag) .When pressed on a particular Handler, we will move
To another page where the user is asked whether he is sure to want to close the
Handler.

* Logs - We want to display the list of all logs in the system. The user will be able to write the type of logs he wants to filter by writing the TYPE LOG in the appropriate field and clicking on the confirmation button.

* Photos - We want to display all the thumbnails of the images that are stored
In Directory Output, where each thumbnail is displayed in a circular way.
